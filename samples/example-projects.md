# Example projects

Here are some example projects to get started easily with the Posemesh SDK.

## Native iOS

* [ArUco/portal scanning & calibration for iOS](https://github.com/aukilabs/LandmarkCalibrationSampleARKit) \
This native iOS project shows how to use ARKit together with posemesh domains. A great starting point for building persistent & collaborative AR experiences on the posemesh.

## Unity (ConjureKit SDK)
_This sample uses the ConjureKit SDK which is getting replaced by the Posemesh SDK. It is still supported as we're building out all parts of the Posemesh SDK._

* [Simple persistent AR experience](https://github.com/aukilabs/simple-persistent-ar-experience)
