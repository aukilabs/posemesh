## The Posemesh - The DePIN for AI perception.

The posemesh is a decentralized machine perception network and collaborative spatial computing protocol for the next 100 billion people, devices and AI on Earth and beyond.

Our mission is to help machines see the world, to enable the future of AI, robotics and the metaverse. To this end, we aim to develop and deploy civilization-scale network infrastructure funded, owned and operated by the people. We build together in public, with the support of our community and backers. This is how we win.
